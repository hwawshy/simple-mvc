# Simple MVC

A simple PHP MVC framework created as a learning excercise.

This is still a work in progress. Do not use in production.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7
- MySQL
- mod_rewrite
- Twig, which can be installed using the **composer update** command

The framework was heavily inspired by https://github.com/daveh/php-mvc
